# Code structure  
##  run.py  
    run.py file is the testing code that generates the exact simulation results submitted to
    AIcrowd, with the score achieves 83.7% accuracy and 0.750 F1 score. We should first use        
    modelcomputing.py to train the model before running run.py. Nonetheless, a pretrained models
    parameters are also ready for testing.
    
##  modelcomputing.py
    modelcomputing.py includes the model training code. We arranged 
    training code and testing code separately to avoid memory being 
    overloaded under which the running speed could potentially be slowed down
